# Phantoms are weak to spectral

> A Minecraft 1.16.x data pack that makes phantoms weak to spectral arrows.

## Installation

Download the latest release from [here][latest] and put the datapack zip file into the `datapacks` folder of your Minecraft world. Download the resourcepack zip file (if available) and enable the pack in your client.

I usually provide resourcepacks to allow translations of my datapacks :)

## License

The data pack is licensed under the GPLv3. For more information, take a look at the license file within this repository.

## Inspiration

I saw this feature in [TrueSurvival][truesurvival] and wanted to have it on my own server :)
